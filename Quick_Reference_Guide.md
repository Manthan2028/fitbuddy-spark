## 🎯 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Run the PowerShell Script
```powershell
# Navigate to your Warp directory
cd "C:\Users\Manthan Shinde\Documents\Warp"

# Execute the template creator
.\Create_Architecture_Template.ps1
```

### 2. PowerPoint Manual Setup (if script doesn't work)
1. **Open PowerPoint** → New Blank Presentation
2. **Design** → Slide Size → Widescreen (16:9)
3. **Insert** → New Slide → Blank Layout
4. **Insert** → Icons → Search architecture terms

### 3. Add Components
1. **Insert** → Icons or Shapes
2. **Format** → Shape Fill → Choose colors
3. **Format** → Shape Effects → Shadow (for depth)
4. **Home** → Arrange → Align objects

### 4. Create Connections
1. **Insert** → Shapes → Lines or Connectors
2. **Format** → Shape Outline → Weight: 2-3pt
3. **Format** → Shape Outline → Arrows → More Arrows
4. Choose appropriate arrowheads

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Web Application Flow:
```
User → CDN → Load Balancer → Web Server → App Server → Database
                                     ↓
                              External APIs
```

### Microservices Architecture:
```
API Gateway → Auth Service → User Service → Database
           → Payment Service → External Payment API
           → Notification Service → Email Service
```

### Data Flow:
```
Primary DB ⟷ Read Replica
     ↓
Cache Layer
     ↓
Data Warehouse ← ETL Pipeline
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Consistency is Key**: Use the same colors for similar component types
2. **Layer Organization**: Keep components on separate layers for easy editing
3. **Smart Connectors**: Use PowerPoint's connector lines that move with objects
4. **Grouping**: Group related components to move them together
5. **Templates**: Save your customized version as a PowerPoint template (.potx)
6. **Animation**: Add subtle animations for presentations (Fade In, 0.5s duration)
7. **Export Options**: Save as PNG for documentation, PDF for sharing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Icons not appearing?
- Update Microsoft Office
- Try Insert → Shapes → Basic Shapes as alternatives

### Arrows not connecting properly?
- Use Insert → Shapes → Lines → Connectors
- Connect to object edges, not centers

### Colors look different?
- Ensure you're using RGB values, not theme colors
- Check printer/display settings

### Can't align objects?
- Select all objects first (Ctrl + A or drag selection)
- Use Format → Align → Distribute evenly

🎯 **Remember**: Start simple and iterate. A clear, well-organized diagram is better than a complex, cluttered one!
