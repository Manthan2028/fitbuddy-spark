## PowerPoint Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create New Presentation
1. Open PowerPoint
2. Create a new blank presentation
3. Set slide size to 16:9 widescreen format

### Step 2: Insert Icons and Shapes
1. Go to Insert → Icons
2. Search for system-related icons:
   - "server", "database", "cloud", "mobile", "web browser"
   - "security", "network", "storage", "API"
3. Insert shapes from Insert → Shapes:
   - Rectangles for containers
   - Arrows for connections
   - Circles for endpoints

### Step 3: Apply Consistent Styling
1. Use the format painter to maintain consistency
2. Set standard sizes: Large components (150x100), Medium (120x80), Small (80x60)
3. Apply shadow effects: Offset Bottom-Right, Blur 10pt

### Step 4: Add Workflow Arrows
1. Use Insert → Shapes → Block Arrows or Connectors
2. Style with 3pt weight, appropriate colors
3. Add arrow heads for direction
4. Label with data flow descriptions

## Customization Tips

### Adding New Components
1. Right-click existing component → Copy
2. Paste and modify text/icon
3. Update colors to match component type
4. Connect with appropriate arrows

### Modifying Layout
1. Use PowerPoint's alignment tools (Format → Align)
2. Distribute components evenly
3. Group related components together
4. Use consistent spacing (20pt between components)

### Animation (Optional)
1. Select components in logical order
2. Apply "Fade In" or "Fly In" animations
3. Set timing to "With Previous" or "After Previous"
4. Use 0.5-second duration for smooth flow

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**: Don't overcrowd the diagram
2. **Use Consistent Sizing**: Similar components should be the same size
3. **Color Code Logically**: Group similar functions with same colors
4. **Label Clearly**: Use concise, descriptive labels
5. **Show Direction**: Always indicate data flow direction
6. **Include Legend**: Add a legend for colors and symbols used

## Export Options

### For Presentations
- Keep as .pptx for editing
- Export to PDF for sharing

### For Documentation
- Export as high-resolution PNG (300 DPI)
- Save as SVG for web use

## Template Variations

### Simple 3-Tier Architecture
- Frontend → Application → Database

### Microservices Architecture
- Multiple services with API gateway
- Service mesh connections
- Individual databases per service

### Cloud-Native Architecture
- Container orchestration
- Serverless functions
- Managed cloud services

### Enterprise Architecture
- Multiple environments (Dev/Test/Prod)
- Security layers
- Integration points
